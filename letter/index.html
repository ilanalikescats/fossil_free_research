        Dear University Presidents and Vice-Chancellors,
        <br />
        <br />
        We are writing as academics and experts who are deeply concerned by
        universities’ collaboration with the fossil fuel industry. Universities
        across the United Kingdom and the United States currently accept
        substantial funding from fossil fuel companies for research aimed at
        solving the very problems this industry causes and continues to
        exacerbate. We believe this funding represents an inherent conflict of
        interest, is antithetical to universities’ core academic and social
        values, and supports industry greenwashing. Thus, it compromises
        universities’ basic institutional integrity, academic freedom, and their
        ability to address the climate emergency.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong class="ul"
            >For these reasons, we are calling on U.K. and U.S. universities to
            institute a ban on accepting fossil fuel industry funding for
            climate change, environmental, and energy policy research.

        >
        To be clear, our concern is not with the integrity of individual
        academics. Rather, it is with the systemic issue posed by the context in
        which academics must work, one where fossil fuel industry funding can
        taint critical climate-related research. There is a clear parallel
        between accepting fossil fuel industry funding for climate change
        research and accepting tobacco industry funding for public health
        research. Already,

        Academics must be free to determine their own research agendas, speak
        their minds, and declare their findings without fear of censorship,
        reprisal, or the withdrawal of funding for future projects. That freedom
        is compromised by reliance on funding from an industry whose core

        research, often faced with few alternative funding pathways. However,
        the risk of skewed outcomes is endemic when research funding is
        dominated by companies with agendas that are in conflict with the goals
        of the funded research. Given the

        effective or good faith partners with universities seeking to pave the
        way for a sustainable future. Collaborating with these companies is
        inimical to academic institutions’ pledges for climate action.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
            University research partnerships with fossil fuel companies play a
            key role in greenwashing these companies’ reputations.
        </strong>
        When universities allow fossil fuel companies to buy and advertise
        connections to university research on key climate and energy issues,
        they inadvertently provide these companies with much-needed scientific
        and cultural legitimacy. This is incredibly valuable to fossil fuel
        companies, as it allows them to report to policymakers, shareholders,
        and the media that they are working with globally respected institutions
        on transition solutions, greenwashing their reputation and cleansing
        their records of climate destruction.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
            Finally, universities that maintain close ties to the fossil fuel
            industry incur a substantial reputational risk.
        </strong>
        We are proud that many universities have publicly committed to tackling
        climate change, notably by divesting their endowments from fossil fuels.
        Yet in allowing fossil fuel companies to fund climate-related research,
        universities violate their own policies and espoused principles, and
        undermine their core social and academic mission. Increasingly, fossil
        fuel industry sponsorship is eroding

        a number of such institutions — including, most recently, the National
        Portrait Gallery in London — to sever ties with the industry. When
        universities have a pivotal role to play in global conversations about
        tackling the climate emergency, they cannot afford to have their voices
        compromised, which is precisely what will happen if they continue to
        make themselves dependent on the industry most responsible for climate
        breakdown.
        <br />
        <br />
        Universities and the research they produce are vital to delivering a
        rapid, just transition away from fossil fuels. However, such efforts are
        undermined by fossil fuel industry funding. Academics should not be
        forced to choose between researching climate solutions and inadvertently
        aiding corporate greenwashing; our universities must provide an
        alternative. Wealthy universities in particular have a duty to lead the
        way in doing so. To all universities, at this moment of extreme crisis,
        we urge you to heed our call and cut damaging research ties with the
        fossil fuel industry.
