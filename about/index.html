                            <p class="bio-text readmore">Geoffrey (he/him) grew up in the UK and is an Associate Professor in the Department of Environmental Science and Policy at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. His research focuses on the history of climate disinformation and propaganda by fossil fuel interests. He has been investigating – and campaigning against – Big Oil’s corporate capture of academia since 2015. He is proud to support Fossil Free Research in defense of universities’ unique capacity to confront the climate crisis, which is being undermined by the exploitation of scientists as pawns of Big Oil propaganda.</p>
