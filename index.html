            <h2>Our letter</h2>
            <p>
                Dear University Presidents and Vice-Chancellors,
                <br><br>
                We are writing as a group of [XXX] academics who are deeply concerned by our universities’ collaboration
                with
                the fossil fuel industry. Universities across the United Kingdom and the United States currently accept
                vast
                sums in funding from fossil fuel companies for research aimed at solving the very problems this industry
                caused
                and continues to exacerbate. We believe this funding is antithetical to universities’ core academic and
                social
                values. It compromises their basic institutional integrity and, as a result, their ability to help
                address
                the
                climate emergency.
                <br><br>
                For these reasons, we are calling on U.K. and U.S. universities to institute a ban on accepting fossil
                fuel
                industry funding for climate change, environmental, and energy policy research.
                <br><br>
                Accepting fossil fuel industry funding for research meant to address the climate crisis undermines the
                academic
                integrity of such research. There is a clear parallel between accepting fossil fuel industry funding for
                climate
                change research and accepting tobacco industry funding for public health research. Already, numerous
                public
                health and research institutions reject tobacco money due to the industry’s extensive record of
                spreading
                disinformation around the public health consequences of its products. Today, the fossil fuel industry
                has
                employed disinformation tactics from the same playbook, working to sow doubt about climate science,
                silence
                industry critics, and stall climate action. How, then, can universities consider these companies
                appropriate
                partners for climate-related research?
                <br><br>
                Fossil fuel funding of climate change research produces a fundamental conflict of interest that
                compromises
                researchers’ academic freedom. Academics must be free to determine their own research agendas, speak
                their
                mind,
                and declare their findings without fear of censorship, reprisal, or the withdrawal of funding for future
                projects. That freedom is inevitably compromised by reliance on funding from an industry whose core
                business
                model is diametrically opposed to science-led climate action. Numerous studies also demonstrate that
                research
                funding by vested industry interests disproportionately yields results favorable to those interests, and
                that
                common safeguards like public disclosure of funding sources are often inadequate to mitigate this skew.
                We
                know
                that many of our colleagues who choose to accept fossil fuel funding strive to produce honest and
                independent
                research, often faced with few alternative funding pathways. However, the risk of skewed outcomes is
                endemic
                where research funding is dominated by companies with particular profit-driven agendas. In order to
                preserve
                the
                basic integrity of crucial climate-related research, universities therefore cannot continue to accept
                funding
                from companies whose business models turn on the maintenance of a fossil fuel economy.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, accepting fossil fuel research funding fundamentally contradicts universities’ stated
                commitments
                to tackling the climate crisis. Fossil fuel companies have covered up and neglected the science of
                climate
                change for decades. Today, despite warnings from the world’s top energy organization that “no investment
                in
                new
                fossil fuel supply projects” can be made if the world is to limit global heating to 1.5°C, all fossil
                fuel
                majors continue to plan new extraction projects decades into the future. Shell is even fighting a Dutch
                court
                order to curb its emissions. Despite boasting about ‘ambitious’ sustainability plans, fossil fuel
                companies’
                investments in oil and gas still dwarf their renewable energy investments, which represent less than 1%
                of
                their
                total capital expenditure. Even the investments they claim as ‘sustainable solutions’ are frequently
                used to
                facilitate additional extraction of fossil fuels and can produce more emissions than they prevent.
                Claims by
                fossil fuel companies that they are leaders in a green transition can therefore not be taken seriously,
                and
                so
                collaborating with these companies is inimical to any institution seeking to lead or just act
                responsibly on
                climate.
                <br><br>
                University research partnerships with fossil fuel companies play a key role in greenwashing their fossil
                reputations. When universities allow fossil fuel companies to buy connections to university research on
                key
                climate and energy issues, universities inadvertently sell these companies much-needed mainstream
                scientific
                legitimacy. We must not underestimate how valuable it is for fossil fuel companies to be able to report
                to
                policymakers, shareholders and the media that they are working with globally respected institutions on
                transition solutions. In short, through research partnerships with prestigious universities across the
                world,
                universities help to wash fossil fuel companies’ reputations green and distract from their records of
                climate
                destruction. Meanwhile, these companies’ behavior mars their academic partners’ credibility. This
                happens as
                governments hesitate to impose stricter sanctions on fossil fuel companies, continue to place their
                lobbyists at
                the heart of key climate policy decisions, and parrot their misleading scientific claims. Our planet
                cannot
                afford such denial and delay any longer.
                <br><br>
                Finally, there is a wider reputational risk for universities who seek to speak authoritatively on the
                climate
                emergency maintaining close ties to the fossil fuel industry. We are proud that many universities have
                publicly
                committed to tackling climate change as a top institutional priority. In particular, we are glad to see
                an
                emerging consensus that institutions of higher education must divest their endowments from fossil fuels.
                Yet
                in
                allowing fossil fuel companies to fund research, many of these universities display a vast inconsistency
                in
                their policies and espoused principles. Increasingly, fossil fuel industry sponsorship is undermining
                scientific
                institutions’ climate credibility, perhaps most notably in relation to the controversy over Shell’s
                sponsorship
                of a Science Museum exhibition on climate change. When universities have a pivotal role to play in
                global
                conversations about tackling the climate emergency, they cannot afford to have their voices compromised
                in
                this
                way, which is precisely what will happen if they continue to embrace the industry most responsible for
                climate
                breakdown.
                <br><br>
                We firmly believe that our universities and the research they produce are vital to delivering a rapid,
                just
                transition away from fossil fuels. However, such efforts are severely undermined by a dependence on
                fossil
                fuel
                industry funding. Academics should not be forced to choose between researching climate solutions and
                inadvertently aiding corporate greenwashing; our universities must provide an alternative. Wealthy,
                well-resourced universities in particular have a duty to lead the way in doing so. Fossil free research
                is
                vital
                for ensuring academics’ freedom to call out the fossil fuel industry’s disinformation campaigns,
                inadequate
                sustainability plans, and failure to accept basic scientific realities. To all universities, at this
                moment
                of
                extreme crisis, we urge you to heed our call and cut research ties with the fossil fuel industry.
