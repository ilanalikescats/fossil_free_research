            <h2>Who we are</h2>
            <p>
                Fossil Free Research is a new campaign to end the toxic influence of fossil fuel money on climate change-related research in universities. It is coordinated by international student divestment and climate justice activists with the support of a wide range
                of academics, climate experts, and university members, as reflected by the letter below.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="letter">
            <h2>Our letter</h2>
            <p> Dear University Presidents and Vice-Chancellors, <br><br> We are writing as academics and experts who are deeply concerned by universities’ collaboration with the fossil fuel industry. Universities across the United Kingdom and the United
                States currently accept substantial funding from fossil fuel companies for research aimed at solving the very problems this industry causes and continues to exacerbate. We believe this funding represents an inherent conflict of interest,
                is antithetical to universities’ core academic and social values, and supports industry greenwashing. Thus, it compromises universities’ basic institutional integrity, academic freedom, and their ability to address the climate emergency.
                <br><br>
                <span class="ul">For these reasons, we are calling on U.K. and U.S. universities to institute a ban on
                    accepting fossil fuel industry funding for climate change, environmental, and energy policy
                    research. </span> <br><br> <span class="bold">Accepting fossil fuel industry funding for research
                    meant to address the climate crisis undermines the academic integrity of climate-related
                    research.</span> To be clear, our concern is not with the integrity of individual academics. Rather, it is with the systemic issue posed by the context in which academics must work, one where fossil fuel industry funding can taint
                critical climate-related research. There is a clear parallel between accepting fossil fuel industry funding for climate change research and accepting tobacco industry funding for public health research. Already, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/04/education/04tobacco.html"

                    inadequate</a> to mitigate this skew. We know that many of our colleagues who choose to accept fossil fuel funding strive to produce honest and independent research, often faced with few alternative funding pathways. However, the risk
                of skewed outcomes is endemic when research funding is dominated by companies with agendas that are in conflict with the goals of the funded research. Given the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-60525591" target="_blank">immense stakes</a>                of the climate crisis and the power of university research to shape public knowledge and policy around a rapid renewable energy transition, this is a risk we simply cannot take. <br><br> <span class="bold">Furthermore, accepting fossil fuel research funding contravenes universities’ stated
                    commitments to tackling the climate crisis.</span> Fossil fuel companies have concealed, trivialized, and neglected the science of climate change for decades.

Though they present themselves as leaders in sustainability, fossil fuel companies’ investments in oil and gas continue to dwarf their renewable energy investments, which represent
                <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2021" target="_blank">just a few percent
                </a> of their total capital expenditure.

                It is clear, therefore, that these companies cannot make for effective or good faith partners with universities seeking to pave the way for a sustainable future. Collaborating with these companies is inimical to academic institutions’
                pledges for climate action.
                <br><br> <span class="bold"> University research partnerships with fossil fuel companies play a key role
                    in greenwashing these companies’ reputations. </span> When universities allow fossil fuel companies to buy and advertise connections to university research on key climate and energy issues, they inadvertently provide these companies
                with much-needed scientific and cultural legitimacy. This is incredibly valuable to fossil fuel companies, as it allows them to report to policymakers, shareholders, and the media that they are working with globally respected institutions
                on transition solutions, greenwashing their reputation and cleansing their records of climate destruction. <br><br> <span class="bold"> Finally, universities that maintain close ties to the fossil

                    substantial reputational risk. </span> We are proud that many universities have publicly committed to tackling climate change, notably by divesting their endowments from fossil fuels. Yet in allowing fossil fuel companies to fund climate-related
                research, universities violate their own policies and espoused principles, and undermine their core social and academic mission. Increasingly, fossil fuel industry sponsorship is eroding <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/nov/19/dozens-of-academics-shun-science-museum-over-fossil-fuel-ties"

When universities have a pivotal role to play in global conversations about tackling the climate emergency,
                they cannot afford to have their voices compromised, which is precisely what will happen if they continue to make themselves dependent on the industry most responsible for climate breakdown. <br><br> Universities and the research they
                produce are vital to delivering a rapid, just transition away from fossil fuels. However, such efforts are undermined by fossil fuel industry funding. Academics should not be forced to choose between researching climate solutions and inadvertently
                aiding corporate greenwashing; our universities must provide an alternative. Wealthy universities in particular have a duty to lead the way in doing so. To all universities, at this moment of extreme crisis, we urge you to heed our call
                and cut damaging research ties with the fossil fuel industry.

            <h2>FAQs</h2>
            <h3>
                Who is “Fossil Free Research” and who is behind this letter?
            </h3>
            <p>The letter is endorsed by a wide range of academics, climate experts, and university members calling on US and UK universities to urgently institute a ban on fossil fuel industry funding for climate change-related research. It was drafted
                by student coordinators of the new Fossil Free Research campaign, who are also organizers with Cambridge Climate Justice and Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, in collaboration with leading academics and experts focused on climate change issues.
            </p>

            <h3>
                <a></a>Why does the letter only address the leadership of US and UK universities?
            </h3>

            <p>We want to see higher education institutions worldwide adopt this ban. We’re starting with US and UK universities because, as some of the most well-resourced and prestigious higher education institutions in the world, in two of the countries
                most responsible for historic global emissions, they have a responsibility to be the first movers in this effort. So many universities in these countries have also already committed to fossil fuel divestment or climate action, making their
                extensive ongoing research ties with the fossil fuel industry all the more indefensible. Enacting a fossil fuel funding ban for climate change, environmental, and energy policy-related research is an intuitive and urgently needed next
                step for these universities to become true climate leaders. </p>

            <h3>
                <a></a>What does the proposed ban include?
            </h3>

            <p>As with divestment, it is clear that this is a policy that will be applied differently in different contexts, and so institutions may want to formulate the ban in slightly different ways. However, at a minimum, such a ban must include the
                Carbon Underground 200, a list of the world’s top 100 coal and top 100 oil and gas publicly traded companies and their subsidiaries. It must also include funding from any company engaged in building new fossil fuel infrastructure or exploring
                for new reserves, as this blatantly ignores the International Energy Agency’s finding that investment in new fossil fuel supply projects must cease immediately if the world is to limit planetary heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius and avoid
                runaway climate breakdown. </p>

            <h3>
                <a></a>Why do we need a ban on fossil fuel-funded climate change-related research at universities?
            </h3>


            <ul>
                <li>Accepting funding for research meant to address the climate crisis from the industry most responsible for causing and perpetuating the climate emergency severely undermines the academic integrity and public credibility of crucial climate-related
                    research. </li>
                <li>Reliance on fossil fuel industry funding for climate change-related research creates an unacceptable conflict of interest between the core business interests of the research funder and the purpose of the research itself. There is clear
                    evidence to suggest that this skews the shape and outcomes of research in directions favorable to the fossil fuel industry. As such, this funding unacceptably infringes on researchers’ academic freedom, constraining their ability to
                    conduct truly free, independent research and speak out against the fossil fuel industry’s record of environmental destruction.
                </li>
                <li>Publicly partnering with the fossil fuel companies responsible for driving the climate emergency fundamentally undermines universities’ stated commitments to tackling the climate crisis. For many universities, these commitments include
                    pledges to divest their endowments from these very same companies on the basis that their business models are fundamentally incompatible with efforts to preserve a safe and liveable future. </li>
                <li>Public research partnerships between globally respected universities and fossil fuel companies play a key role in greenwashing these companies’ reputations. This helps to bolster the industry’s false claims that it is at the forefront
                    of the green transition when it continues to invest the vast majority of its capital into fossil fuel exploration and extraction, in clear defiance of the scientific evidence. Indeed, the industry invests only a tiny fraction of its
                    overall budget into renewable energy and low-carbon solutions, with many of these alleged solutions failing to meaningfully help curb emissions. By accepting fossil fuel companies as legitimate partners for sustainability research,
                    universities signal to the world that these companies are actually committed to science-led climate action and deserve a seat at the table in deciding the future of our planet.</li>
                <li>Finally, universities that maintain close ties to the fossil fuel industry incur a substantial reputational risk through this clear violation of their core social and academic principles. This undermines public faith in academic institutions
                    to speak authoritatively on this most pressing crisis at a time when the contributions of independent scientists are needed more than ever.</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>
                <a></a>Who supports this ban?
            </h3>

            <p>This ban is supported by hundreds of leading academics, university affiliates, and experts from a broad range of disciplines in addition to climate, environmental, and energy sciences, economics, and policy. This list includes lead IPCC assessment
                authors, a Nobel Peace Prize recipient, the former President of Ireland, world-renowned economists, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, and university chancellors. This letter is also supported by numerous university fossil fuel divestment
                campaigns including Cambridge Climate Justice, Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, and Sunrise GW. </p>

            <h3>
                <a></a>What about alternative research funding? Where will the money for this research come from if not from fossil fuel companies?
            </h3>

            <p>It is imperative that rich US and UK universities and governments lead the way in ensuring that critical climate change-related research receives the funding it requires. Many universities have large, well-established fundraising departments
                which have demonstrated a capacity to raise phenomenal sums. Indeed, philanthropic giving to US universities rose by 6.9% in 2021 alone, topping $52 billion dollars. Additionally, it is the duty of governments to step in to provide funding
                so clearly in the public good when and where it is needed. </p>
            <p>Moreover, it is not clear how much funding for climate change-related research comes from the fossil fuel industry to US and UK universities for climate change-related research. That’s because of a strong lack of transparency and disclosure
                on these universities’ behalf, which raises serious doubts about these universities’ commitments to being responsible climate actors. </p>
            <p>As we have already detailed, serious issues arise with any amount of fossil fuel industry funding for climate change-related research. By its very nature, such funding incurs the unjustifiably problematic risk of university climate change-related
                research being skewed in the direction of fossil fuel companies’ interests as well as being used to support their greenwashing and continued efforts to delay and control the direction of climate action, which has deadly consequences for
                our community and our planet. It must therefore be an urgent priority for governments and universities to pursue alternative funding pathways to ensure critical climate-related research can be conducted untainted by the biasing, greenwashing
                effects of fossil fuel industry funding. </p>

            <h3>
                <a></a>Can’t fossil fuel industry funding end up funding good or important climate research at universities, even if the source is undesirable?
            </h3>

            <p>There is clear evidence to suggest that accepting fossil fuel industry funding for any climate change, environmental, and energy policy research creates significant conflicts of interest and skews research agendas and outcomes in directions
                favorable to the fossil fuel industry. This severely undermines the potential positive impact of such research. </p>
            <p>Just as importantly, accepting this funding lends much-needed scientific legitimacy to companies who continue to fight against a rapid and just renewable energy transition. Note that no major fossil fuel company has yet aligned its business
                model with the goals of the Paris Agreement. In this context, affiliations with prestigious university research allow these companies to continue falsely representing themselves as leaders in a green transition they are actively blocking.
                Even in cases where climate change-related research funded by fossil fuel companies has not been distorted by this funding source, the appearance of compromised academic integrity will be there regardless and impossible to wash away just
                because disclosure of funding is made.</p>

            <h3>
                <a></a>What precedents exist for this ban?
            </h3>

            <p>There are numerous examples of institutions refusing money from certain industries on both scientific and ethical grounds. Since the late 1990s, tobacco companies have increasingly been barred from providing funding for clinical research at
                many public health institutions (notably including the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, Cancer Research UK, and the British Heart Foundation) due to these companies’ extensive record of spreading misinformation about the public
                health harms of their products. This precedent is crucial given that fossil fuel industry funding of climate-related research presents a similar conflict of interest, with fossil fuel companies employing disinformation tactics directly
                from the tobacco industry’s playbook.</p>
            <p>Over the last decade, we have also seen an overwhelming trend among higher education institutions, non-profit organizations, pension funds, and other major asset managers of divesting from the fossil fuel industry precisely because all of
                them recognize the industry’s behavior and core business model as being morally reprehensible and at odds with their core values. More recently, prestigious cultural institutions have reached a similar conclusion and begun to sever ties
                with the fossil fuel industry. For instance, the National Portrait Gallery recently decided to end its 30-year partnership with BP over the company’s appalling environmental record, and there is a major campaign for the Science Museum
                to do the same. </p>

            <h3>
                <a></a>Why are you making this call amid the Russian invasion in Ukraine and the ripple effects on energy supply?
            </h3>

            <p>The call to reject funding from fossil fuel companies for climate change-related research is particularly salient in the wake of the latest IPCC report and the Russian war on Ukraine, which has made abundantly clear the need for vast investment
                in and development of renewable energy infrastructure for the well-being and survival of our communities and future generations, and global security. Meanwhile, fossil fuel companies are cashing in on soaring energy prices to secure record
                profits and continue to invest tiny proportions of their overall capital budgets on renewables. As these companies exploit the humanitarian crisis for their own gain and work to sustain their deadly core business model, it is obvious that
                we simply cannot trust these companies with the future of our planet. &nbsp;Shell’s decision to purchase a tankard of Russian oil in the midst of this crisis represents yet another example of the industry’s commitment to profit-making
                at the expense of all standards of basic morality and human decency.</p>
